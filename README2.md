## Phase 1 Project: Star Wars Personality Test
For my first project, I made a Star Wars themed presonality test site. On this site, the user will answer a questionaire that has 16 questions. Based on the answers provided by the user, it will tell the user which Star Wars character they most resembles.

## Requirements

* App runs on a single page

* Open the html file

## Resources
